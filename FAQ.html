        <h3>My video is lagging?</h3>
        <p>
            In the case of either a DDoS attack or
            heavy server load due to natural video streaming
            the server, will indeed, lag. Currently, Ben is working on a sort of torrent style streaming for bobPlayer.

        <h3>Why do barely any pages have a "Ben's Review"?</h3>
        <p>
            Short answer: <b>I'm busy</b><br>
            Long answer: I'm busy. Very, very, busy. It's year 10 (for me), I have more to study than keeping up with Bob Ross.
            I do want to <b>eventually</b> add reviews for every single episode, but, for now, you'll have to do with a few reviews.
        </p>
