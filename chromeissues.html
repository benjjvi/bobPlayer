        <h3>a. You are using Chrome/Chromium based Microsoft Edge, and want to try and access Bob Ross episodes.</h3>

        <h5>
            <a class="solida" href="https://bildsben.hopto.org:8010">Click here to visit the server that hosts the Bob Ross episodes.</a>
            Currently, the only 2 recommended ways you can view the videos in Chrome/Chromium based Microsoft Edge is to; 
            <li>a. click the link above, and physically download the video.</li>
            <li>b. use a different browser that works with bobPlayer, such as Firefox, Safari, and any non-chrome based browsers.</li>
            There is another way, that we will look at in section c, however it is not recommended due to it possibly using a lot of data, which can be problematic on limited connections (e.g mobile data/LTE/4G/provider restrictions).

        <h3>b. You are curious on what is actually causing the problem.</h3>

            Short answer: I do not know.
            <br><br>
            Long answer:<br>
            The web server that hosts the Bob Ross videos is running off of a Ruby (on Rails) server, hosted on a RPi 3.
            Originally, I believed the issue to be the video format that was being delivered to Chrome/Chromium based Microsoft Edge (which was ogv). 
            This didn't seem to be the reason Chrome/Chromium based Microsoft Edge wouldn't properly display. Infact, it was actually the reason that Safari wouldn't play video. 
            After discovering that Safari would not play .ogv videos, I encoded all 405 episodes of Bob Ross to the .mp4 format, using the .h264 format.
            I believed that maybe specifically forcing Handbrake to encode via the .h264 codec would allow the videos to play. It wouldn't.
            I then discovered that in the DevConsole of Chrome/Chromium based Microsoft Edge, the requests for videos was being blocked due to the server running on HTTP.
            I decided to look for a SSL certificate provider, and found punchsalad.com's SSL certificate generator.
            It uses Let's Encrypt to generate certificates. I am still using this site, since it is just good practise to ensure that your server runs on HTTPS.
            However, this was still not resolving the issue. Now, I still do not have an answer as to why Chrome/Chromium based Microsoft Edge will not play the videos, since Chrome/Chromium based Microsoft Edge can indeed read the files.
            I have decided to pin it down to the server that I am using (Ruby on Rails). I run the server using the built in httpd script.
            I noticed that with the previous server that I was using (which was running on python), a similar issue occured, which is why I decided to switch to Ruby on Rails.

            There is ONE way to be able to allow Chrome/Chromium based Microsoft Edge to render the videos in Chrome/Chromium based Microsoft Edge.
            It requires opening the DevConsole in Chrome/Chromium based Microsoft Edge, and TICKING the box that says "Disable Cache". 
            Below is a video (that actually plays) on how to do this. 
            Ensure that you have sound enabled on your browser to better understand the instructions.<br><br>

            Any help would be greatly appreciated, as this project is the first time I have done stuff with video streaming. 
            It is most likely some sort of codec issue, however I cannot seem to make it work, even only with small test batches.
