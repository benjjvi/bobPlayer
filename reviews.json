    1: "The first episode of Bob Ross! This episode is actually really good to understand exactly what will happen in the following episodes. The episode helps to settle you into the joys of painting. He introduces you to how anyone can paint. I love his analogy: 'We have always thought that we had to go to school all our lives, or even be blessed by Michaelangelo', when really, all you need is a calm place, the right equiptment, and the energy to start painting! He introduces you one by one to the colours that we will use for each and every episode of this >400 episode repository of Bob Ross episodes. I have noticed that he pronounces white with a real emphasis on the 'w' and 'h'.",
