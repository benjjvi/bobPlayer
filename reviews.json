    1: "The first episode of Bob Ross! This episode is actually really good to understand exactly what will happen in the following episodes. The episode helps to settle you into the joys of painting. He introduces you to how anyone can paint. I love his analogy: 'We have always thought that we had to go to school all our lives, or even be blessed by Michaelangelo', when really, all you need is a calm place, the right equiptment, and the energy to start painting! He introduces you one by one to the colours that we will use for each and every episode of this >400 episode repository of Bob Ross episodes. I have noticed that he pronounces white with a real emphasis on the 'w' and 'h'.",
    404: "This episode helps to introduce you to the style of Bob Ross. I would watch this video after episode 405 (the 3 hour special), as it gives you all the information you need to start painting along with Bob. He goes in depth on what each technique actually does, and how to make some amazing scenes.",
    405: "In this episode, Bob gives us a list of all the equiptment we will need to paint along with him. He tells you the names of each colour, and gets straight into some lovely painting! He teaches you all the different methods used throughout the show. First, we take a look at skies, and later on in the episode, we cover some other of Bob's famous techniques."
